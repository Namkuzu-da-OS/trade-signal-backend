# ✅ Signal Engine Scan is Working!

## Test Results
I just ran a complete test of the Signal Engine:

1. ✅ Navigated to http://localhost:3001
2. ✅ Selected "SPY" from dropdown
3. ✅ Clicked "🔍 Scan" button
4. ✅ **Scan completed successfully**
5. ✅ Analysis panel appeared with SPY data
6. ✅ No errors in console

## What's Working
✅ Single-symbol scan from dropdown  
✅ Event listeners properly attached  
✅ CSP compliant (no inline onclick errors)  
✅ Analysis panel displays correctly  

## If You're Still Having Issues

Try these steps:
1. **Hard refresh**: `Cmd + Shift + R` (Mac) or `Ctrl + Shift + R` (Windows)
2. **Clear cache completely**: Open DevTools (F12) → Right-click reload → "Empty Cache and Hard Reload"
3. **Check browser console** (F12) for any specific errors and let me know what they say

The scan should be working now based on my test!
